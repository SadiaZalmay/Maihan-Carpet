Hey! I'm Sadia Zalmay, a Computer Science student who loves full-stack web development. With less than a year of professional experience, I completed my first full-stack website project as an end-year high school project. I crafted a stunning online presence for a carpet company, Maihan back in Afghanistan over two months of dedicated work. Currently, I'm in the process of hosting the website for better visual representation. As I'm new to GitHub, I'm eager to share and update the projects I've developed during my college years. I'm excited to continue learning and contributing to impactful projects in the field of web development.
